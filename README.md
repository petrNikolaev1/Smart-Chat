# Smart-Chat
Simple Chat with the client side implemented using React JS &amp; Redux and the server side on Express &amp; Web Sockets. 

## Getting Started

To run the application and enjoy chatting, you need just to download the project, unzip it and type
```
npm run start
```
in the command line in the project directory. 

### How it works
Currently there is a public chat accessible for all visitors in read-only mode. To be able to send messages, it is enough just to log in with a unique username. You can keep chatting privately with any online user you want or make contributions to the public chat. There is a possibility to edit your messages, but not later than a minute after the publishing.
